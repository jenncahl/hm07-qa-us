# Sprint 7 project
In project 7 I wrote API Tests in JavaScript, with help HTTP requests.
In every handler: DELETE,GET,POST AND PUT I tested 2 things: if response is successful- (201 Created or 200 OK),
and if content of response is exact like in API DOCS(expected).

To make tests run, first we need to update URL in config.js file

Before subbmiting project, I had to push changes from Visual Studio to GtiHub, to help tutor see my work.
I did it with commands: git add . 
git commit -m "changes"
git push origin main

To run tests, we need to send command  npx jest
