# Sprint 7 project
In project 7 I wrote 8 tests in JavaScript with help of API(using endopoints).
Method used: JEST (javascript framework for testing), API. Everything in JSON format which is the most common for storing data and exchanging data
I used APIdocs to see expected results, and also Postman, to compare if my tests are positive or negative.

In every handler: DELETE,GET,POST AND PUT I tested 2 things: if response is successful- (201 Created or 200 OK),
and if content of response is exact like in API DOCS(expected).

 I use Visual Studio Code programe.
first we need to update URL in config.js file
to run tests I use command: npx jest

Before subbmiting project, I had to push changes from Visual Studio to GtiHub, to let tutor see my work.
I did it with commands: git add . 
git commit -m "changes"
git push origin main

To run tests, we need to send command  npx jest


To see my work, tutor have to clone:
