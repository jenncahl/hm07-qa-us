# Sprint 7 project
In project 7 I wrote API Tests in JavaScript, with help HTTP requests.
In every handler: DELETE,GET,POST AND PUT I tested 2 things: if response is successful- (201 Created or 200 OK),
and if content of response is exact like in API DOCS(expected).

To make tests run, first we need to update URL in config.js file
